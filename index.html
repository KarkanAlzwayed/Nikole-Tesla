      <ul>
        <li>July 10th, 1856: Tesla's Birth:<br>
  Tesla was born "at the stroke of midnight" with lightning striking during a summer storm. He was born to a Serbian family in Smiljan near Gospić, Lika, (the Military Frontier of Austria-Hungary, now in Croatia). The midwife commented, "He'll be a child of the storm," to which his mother replied, "No, of light." Tesla was baptized in the Old Slavonic Church rite. His Baptism Certificate reports that he was born on June 28 (Julian calendar; July 10 in the Gregorian calendar) 1856, and christened by the Serbian orthodox priest, Toma Oklobdžija.<br><br></li>

  Tesla moves to Karlovac (Carlstadt), Croatia and stays with his aunt and Col. "Old War-Horse" Branković. He attends "Higher Real Gymnasium" where teacher Martin Sekulić teaches him math and physics and has a decisive influence on him. Tesla graduates Gimnazije Karlovac a year early.<br><br></li>
        <li>1873: Tesla Contracts Cholera<br>
  Tesla returns to Gospić in spite of his father's instructions otherwise. Shortly after arriving he contracts Cholera. He is bedridden for 9 months and was near death many times.

        <li>1874: Tesla Eludes Army Service<br>
  Tesla went to Tomingaj near Gračac to recover from Cholera and avoid the Army, from which he was a fugitive, due to required a compulsory three-years' service. Tesla later stated, "For most of this term I roamed in the mountains, loaded with a hunter's outfit and a bundle of books, and this contact with nature made me stronger in body as well as in mind."<br><br></li>
        <li>September, 1875: Tesla Attends College In Graz
  Tesla enrolled at the Austrian Polytechnic School in Graz on a Military Border scholarship. In his first year, Tesla never missed a lecture, made the highest grades possible and started a Serbian culture club. During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo when he suggested that commutators weren't necessary. At the end of the second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and took up gambling. Near the end of the third year, Tesla stopped attending lectures and dropped out the following year.<br><br></li>
